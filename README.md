# CSE 320: Programming Languages

- These 5 programming languages implements the following algorithms:

1) Quicksort on an Array
- For this problem, you will need to generate arrays of 1000 to 10000 3 or 4 digit integers. You should generate the array using the random() function in a C++ program. (try: "man random" at command line for reference on this)

2) Partition Sum
- This algorithm has exponential complexity, so your data should be a short list - the example in the reference uses less than ten numbers, you may want to use several different input lists of less than 20 numbers.
